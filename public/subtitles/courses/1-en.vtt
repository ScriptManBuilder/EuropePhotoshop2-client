00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome! My name is Kara Plitnit. I've been a photographer,

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
graphic designer, and professional pixel pusher for over 20 years.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I've been photoshopping since the 90s. And I've been

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
teaching for almost just as long with classes on everything

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
from photoshop to design, Illustrator, and more.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And after all these years, beginners are still my damn.

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So if you have ever wanted to get started in photoshop,

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but you felt overwhelmed or intimidated, I get it.

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I have been there. I'll introduce you to the workspace,

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
give you the no nonsense low down on keyboard shortcuts

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and demystify everything from layers to smart objects

12
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and file formats to image size and resolution.

13
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
You'll learn how to work with type, how to take advantage

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
of incredible font features you might not have even known existed.

15
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And everything you need to know get started making selections

16
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and using layer masks. Along the way, you'll complete

17
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
some quirky practice projects. Discover a few hidden surprises

18
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and have a fair amount of fun. All the practice files

19
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
are included along with a printable cheat sheet

20
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
of common photoshop keyboard shortcuts.

21
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
By the end of this class, in addition to a profound

22
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
sense of accomplishment, you'll have a solid understanding

23
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
of photoshop basics and the foundation you need

24
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to tackle whatever you plan to take on next.

25
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So I'm excited for you and the adventure that

26
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
you're about to embark on. What are we waiting for?

27
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
